<h2 style="font-weight: 600">Hi, I'm Chris.</h2>

I am a 👨🏼‍💻 software engineer and 🔬 researcher currently working at MIT Lincoln Laboratory. I have a 🎓 B.S. in Computer Science & Cognitive Science and am working on a Master's in Computer Science. Connect with me on Twitter or Instagram, and checkout what I'm up to on my [GitHub](https://github.com/chrisvander). I occasionally write blog posts here, and if it's about Apple products, I write over at [The Ecosystem](https://theecosystemblog.com). Thanks for stopping by!
