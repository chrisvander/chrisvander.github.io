Apple was not kidding when they made the name of the event Spring Loaded. This was loaded with new product releases and updates, and hopefully everyone is satisfied. I'm going to briefly cover everything Apple announced today and give a few short thoughts, and I'll breakdown the products in future posts.

**All Updates:**

- Apple Card Family
- Podcasts
- Purple iPhone 12/12 mini
- AirTag
- Apple TV 4K
- iMac
- iPad Pro

## Apple Card Family

Apple Card offers the ability to designate a co-owner of the credit card, and credit reporting will be done for both users, equally. This joint feature is one of many oft-requested features since Apple Card's introduction. Additionally, users in the same family sharing group above the age of 13 can be allowed to use the Apple Card up to a particular spending limit. This sharing can occur through one Apple Card account. It seems like a great new set of features for Apple Card. Family sharing offers a lot for families and Apple always continues to offer more with it through its services.

Being a credit card, these features just come with the card through software, so there's no price point to comment on. If you like these features and it's relevant for your situation, take advantage of it!

## Podcasts

I've always been apprehensive about making podcasts a subscription arena. Podcasts have always been a free way, less-controlled medium, and I didn't enjoy the idea of some Podcasts+ service. Luckily, Apple didn't go down the route of a combined monthly fee with original programming or buying in big content creators. They just enabled content creators the opportunity to offer podcasts through a paid route, supporting the podcast through user support instead of sponsor-based advertisements. This move is clearly to the benefit of the content creators, and I think it's a smart one.

Personally, I'm sticking to the free podcasts. There are too many subscriptions these days for me to get caught up in individual show subscriptions. The redesigned Podcasts app is a nice plus for me, and I think Apple went about this the right way.

## Purple iPhone 12/12 mini

It's the iPhone 12 and 12 mini you love, but now in purple! Not much else to say here, but it is a nice color.

## AirTag

Getting to the big announcements. AirTag has been rumored for quite some time, and it's nice to see it finally be released. They're cheaper than I thought, at $29 for one or $99 for a 4-pack. While pricey, they're competitive with Tile and other offerings while offering the full advantage of being first-party. The big advantage here: ultra wideband tracking.

Now, while this feature is relevant for owners of the iPhone 11 or later devices, the Precision Tracking feature is awesome. Being able to be guided to the AirTag step-by-step with incredible accuracy is a phenomenal step up from Tile and other offerings. If you own one of the newer iPhones, AirTag is definitely a buy. If you value being able to find your belongings but own an older iPhone, I still think it's worth the purchase, just because of the Find My network. Utilizing the billion Apple devices out on the planet, if you lose an AirTag and are out of range of that, there's bound to be an Apple device in range to pick up the signal.

Accessories range from $29-39. Keep in mind that 3rd party accessory makers will undoubtably make cheaper key rings and loops for AirTag. Look for those when finding the perfect key ring.

AirTag releases on Friday, April 23. There will be a Herm√®s brand AirTag, with hand crafted leather accessories, and those come out April 30.

## Apple TV 4K

The new Apple TV 4K doesn't necessitate you running out and replacing your current Apple TV, but it's got a nice spec bump up to an A12 Bionic chip while preserving the same price tag as before. HDR with high frame rate is the big new feature with the hardware, and that's about it. Unless you actually need a new Apple TV, it's not something to consider upgrading to.

However, Apple also unveiled comes with a fully redesigned Siri remote. The remote itself costs $59, and is compatible with the previous generation Apple TV 4K. The remote is thicker, making it far less easy to lose. It features actual arrow buttons and it maintains touch sensitivity for quick swiping around. It also adds a power button for the TV. The remote itself is worth a purchase for sure, it's a much-needed update to the previous Siri remote and I will definitely be picking up a new remote.

## iMac/iPad Pro

I'll write separate posts regarding the new 24" iMac and the iPad Pro. Both of these devices now feature the M1 chip, which is gives each device large boosts in speed. The iMac offers a lot of new features, and spoiler alert, if you're in the market for a desktop Mac, 9 times out of 10 the iMac will offer everything you're looking for. The iPad features display tech and power that seems impossible given the size of the chassis, but it's still an open question whether it's worth the asking price given the capabilities of the software.

## Conclusion

This event was packed with products and updates, and there's something for everyone here. I will likely be picking up the new Siri Remote and AirTags, and will offer my thoughts on these when I have them in-hand.
