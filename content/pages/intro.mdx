# Hi, I'm Chris.
## I'm a highly skilled, motivated developer.

I have experience at several organizations such as MIT Lincoln Laboratory, SAP, GE Aviation, and others. I'm experienced with many different software stacks. I am a leader, through Greek organizations I've been involved with and through the technical group projects I've worked on. 

Currently I am pursuing a Master's of Science in Computer Science from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. I am also completing a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science and Cognitive Science. My master's focus is on Reinforcement Learning, and I am working with MIT Lincoln Laboratory on a master's project.
