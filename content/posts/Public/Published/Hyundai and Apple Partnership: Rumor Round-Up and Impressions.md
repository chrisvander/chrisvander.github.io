New rumors lit up earlier this week regarding "Project Titan," Apple's self-driving car. It appears that Apple may be pursuing a partnership with Hyundai Motor to manufacture their automobile. Their conversation was confirmed by Hyundai itself. https://twitter.com/stevekopack/status/1347351171032354817?s=21

A report from [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-hyundai-motor-apple/apple-hyundai-to-agree-on-electric-car-tie-up-early-this-year-korea-it-news-idUSKBN29F0C1) indicates that production would start in 2024. Hyundai would act as a partner in producing the vehicle (and potentially the batteries) as Apple does not yet have the capability to manufacture at the scale they would desire. It's likely Hyundai would also help manufacture the ["next-level" battery technology](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/21/apple-targets-car-production-by-2024.html).

## History of Project Titan

Starting in 2014, Apple started a new project known as "Project Titan." This project initially involved hundreds of employees and its goal was to provide a self-driving Apple-branded car aimed at consumers. The difference between these two reminds me of the rumors that Apple was making a full-fledged TV set, [until that project was shelved](https://www.wsj.com/articles/behind-apples-move-to-shelve-tv-plans-1431992617?mod=LS1).

[According to AppleInsider](https://appleinsider.com/articles/15/09/14/apples-project-titan-car-initiative-negatively-impacting-teslas-product-development-source-says) in 2015, Apple had nearly 1,000 employees working on developing the car, and was poaching enough employees from Tesla to affect their Model 3 production. In 2016, it seems that the plans had fell through, with many of the thousand employees leaving and the focus of the project falling to just software ([The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/17/13303710/apple-car-project-titan-self-driving-focus)). At the time, it was believed Apple would license software to car manufacturers to enable next-level self-driving. Soon enough, the project shifted back towards the manufacturing of an actual vehicle.

In 2018 Doug Field (a former Tesla employee) was handed the project to oversee and laid off 190 employees in 2019. During those layoffs, an Apple spokesperson [reported to CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/24/apple-lays-off-over-200-from-project-titan-autonomous-vehicle-group.html) the following:

> We continue to believe there is a huge opportunity with autonomous systems, that Apple has unique capabilities to contribute, and that this is the most ambitious machine learning project ever.

In 2020, the project was moved to be under the leadership of John Giannandrea, Apple's AI and machine learning chief. Apple's focus is clear with their artificial intelligence investments - they intend to create a car that excels at self-driving.

## My Take

A car manufactured by a company that's led the industry through their mobile devices would be a first. But, Apple has the most resources to lead the charge. According to a post from 9to5Mac earlier today, Apple is targeting [production capacity of 400,000 units](https://9to5mac.com/2021/01/10/apple-car-hyundai-production-deal/) per year. In order to compete in the car segment at those volumes, Apple would need to sell the car at a mass-market price. Most of the [best-selling vehicles of 2020](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/g32006077/best-selling-cars-2020/) cost less than $40,000, and only 4 of the 25 models managed to exceed the 400,000 unit number. 

The price of an electric car is highly reliant on the battery technology used. If reports are to be believed, they're attempting to reduce the price of the car by using a "radical" new battery technology. This could enable the Apple Car to get a price under $40,000 while maintaining a battery pack size that lets it go over 250 miles on a charge. 

When Apple enters a segment, they want to build the best product in that segment without compromises. The limits they have are the scale they want to achieve, and the price of the components to manufacture the car. Expect a price tag that doesn't quite place it in the luxury segment, higher-than-average range, and a clear focus on simplicity, ecosystem integration, and self-driving.
