My time with the iA Writer tool has been awesome. It's everything that I've hoped for in a writing tool. 

The syntax highlighting is abundantly useful. It lets me know how my sentence structure works. This will certainly make me a better writer. And with this new keyboard, what better time to try?

Love it!

```javascript
const test = 'hello'
```

```html
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Test</title>
	</head>
</html>
```
